# Circumference-of-a-Circle-Tool
Good to see you again!
This next repo is for a little bit of JavaScript.
With the use of JavaScript we can implement math into the site to calculate the circumference of a circle! 
Thank you BroCode!!

## Access to the tool ⬇️

## How the Tool Works
The circumfernce tool is used mainly to... well get the curcumference of a circle.

In math there is a couple formulas used to get the circumfernce.

C=PI2Radius
C=PI*D
D is for Diameter
This Tool currently uses the first equation. Later builds I will add the section equation for users how may only have the diameter

### Features
* All you need is your radius of the circle and you can get the circumference!

## Future Plans
I want this project to be a "work" in progress for my git repository. I will be adding diffrent uploads at differnt times and differnt versions. 
The next update will be mostly for graphical deisigning as the main build right now only has HTML code in it.

* Graghical Lift
* More math function
  * Current Build onyly used the radius to find the circumference. I hope to add a feature for if users only have the diameter.
